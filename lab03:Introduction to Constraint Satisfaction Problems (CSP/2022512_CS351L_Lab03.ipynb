        "# Exam Scheduling Scenario Using Degree Heuristic\n",
        "# ===================================================\n",
        "# Scenario:\n",
        "# This script simulates a university exam scheduling problem where we need to assign time slots\n",
        "# to exams without causing conflicts. The conflicts arise when two or more exams share common\n",
        "# students, meaning these exams cannot be scheduled in the same time slot.\n",
        "# The goal is to assign time slots (represented by colors) to each exam (represented by nodes in the graph)\n",
        "# such that no two conflicting exams are scheduled at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Explanation of Modifications:\n",
        "# 1. Graph Representation:\n",
        "#    - The graph represents the exam scheduling problem where each node represents an exam,\n",
        "#      and edges between nodes represent conflicts (shared students).\n",
        "#    - A random graph is generated where edges indicate exams that cannot share the same time slot.\n",
        "# 2. Heuristic Choice (Degree Heuristic):\n",
        "#    - We have used the **Degree Heuristic**, which prioritizes the scheduling of exams with the highest degree\n",
        "#      (i.e., exams that have the most conflicts or neighbors).\n",
        "#    - This heuristic is chosen because it helps resolve more complex scheduling problems first, reducing the likelihood\n",
        "#      of conflicts later in the process.\n",
        "#    - The function `select_unassigned_node_Degree` chooses the next exam to schedule based on the number of conflicts it has.\n",
        "# 3. Visualization:\n",
        "#    - At each step, the current state of the scheduling (graph coloring) is visualized.\n",
        "#    - Each color represents a different time slot, and we can track the process step by step as exams are assigned time slots.\n",
        "# 4. Backtracking with Degree Heuristic:\n",
        "#    - The backtracking algorithm has been adapted to use the Degree Heuristic to select the next node (exam) to color.\n",
        "#    - If a valid time slot is found for the current exam, it is assigned, and the algorithm proceeds to the next exam.\n",
        "#    - If no valid time slot is found, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different time slot for the previous exam.\n",
