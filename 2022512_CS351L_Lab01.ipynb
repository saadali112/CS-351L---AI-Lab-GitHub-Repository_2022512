        "\n",
        "In each iteration, the AI makes a random guess from the remaining valid numbers in possible_guesses.\n",
        "The random choice is implemented using random.choice(list(possible_guesses)), ensuring that the guess is unpredictable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. User Feedback Handling:\n",
        "After each guess, the user provides feedback in the form of:\n",
